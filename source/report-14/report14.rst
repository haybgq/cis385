Overview
--------

At the beginning of this capstone, I recall being nervous as I contemplated
whether I knew enough about software automation to submit weekly reports that
provided substantive information on the topics I was covering. Well, therein
lay the problem: The purpose of this capstone was to demonstrate the ability
to be a lifelong learner, capable of learning new technologies via research
and application. It was not about what I already knew, but rather, what I was
going to learn during the semester.

There is an ironic component to this class, where the student temporarily
becomes the teacher, and the teacher is a student. I am grateful to Dr. Craven
for making this a fun class and learning new automation concepts with me; he
seemed almost as excited as I was whenever I shared what I had learned.

This report is, therefore, a reflection on lessons learned during my journey to
the finish line.

1. Technical Skills Learned During the Semester
-----------------------------------------------

The most rewarding aspect of working with the Selenium suite is that it allows
you to touch on a multitude of layers ranging from a basic understanding of
HTML and CSS, to working with programming languages and API components. Some
technical skills learned during the course of this class include:

* **Installing and Configuring Selenium**: In :ref:`Reports 1, 2 <report1-2>`
  and :ref:`3 <report-3>`, I covered how to set up both Selenium WebDriver and
  Selenium IDE from the very beginning. This required getting to understand the
  necessary architecture, components and modules to implement successful
  automation testing.

* **Selenese**: Geting familiar with the language used to write selenium
  commands was another key skill acquired. This included understanding the
  browser-element relationship and learning how to use locators and
  interaction commands as outlined in :ref:`Report 4 <report-4>`.

* **Sphinx and ReStructuredText**: I was not familiar with the Sphinx
  documentation generator or the reStructuredText (reST) markup language. I have
  even incorporated it into my repositories at work.

* **Git and GitHub**: While I had heard of Git, I had never spent much time
  learning or using Git commands to manage source code. This class gave me an
  opportunity to learn more and apply Git commands, while also allowing me to
  explore GitHub in detail. This has especially been beneficial in my
  professional life where I now get to manage code commits (git), review
  diffs and approve pull requests as needed. The practical applications have
  been endless for me.

* **The Differences between Bitwise and Boolean Logical Operators in Python**:
  Dr. Carolyn Brodie was not amused when I informed her that I had been using
  bitwise operators to evaluate Boolean expressions in my Python code. By the
  time I got to inform her that Dr. Craven had walked me through why this was
  not advisable, she referred me back to a chapter where she expressly
  encourages the use of logical operators. This was a case where I had developed
  a terrible coding habit due to having a background in Java, but also because I
  like to write shorter code (provided it is readable). The joke here, as I
  recently realized, was that using the logical operator ``or``, or the bitwise
  ``|``, both required the same number of clicks on the keyboard.

2. Continuous Education Post-Graduation
---------------------------------------

With current technological trends changing each day, it important to stay
up-to-date if one is to remain marketable in today's technology job market. In
fact, college simply provides *breadth* of knowledge in courses. The *depth*
comes with specialization and continuous education. I plan on remaining a
lifelong learner through the following methods:

* **Certifications and Online Trainings**: My next step post-graduation
  is to complete Amazon Web Services certifications, starting with the
  Certified Cloud Practitioner. However, I also plan on keeping up with current
  trends via other online training platforms such as Udemy and Coursera.
  Anything that requires re-certifying often helps ensure continuous learning.

* **Attending Tech Conferences**: It is a good idea to keep an eye out for tech
  conferences/symposiums and discuss latest trends with peers. These often
  provide glimpses into different approaches of doing the same things, thus
  limiting the likelihood of having tunnel vision.

* **Teach/Train Others Periodically**: I am an avid supporter of
  `the protégé effect <https://priiparmar.wordpress.com/2016/02/12/the-protege-effect/>`_
  which contends that the best way to learn is to teach. An added benefit to
  this approach is that it encourages me to keep up with the latest trends,
  thus allowing me to have the most up-to-date training.

* **Keeping in Touch with Professors**: I have a particularly great relationship
  with Dr. Carolyn Brodie and often go to her whenever I have an interesting
  coding or computer improvement idea. I will continue to connect with her and
  share ideas/learn from her whenever our schedules permit. I hope to have this
  relationship with more professors where possible.

* **Pursuing a Master's Degree**: While this is not completely set in stone,
  I plan to pursue a `Master's of Science in Data Science <https://sps.northwestern.edu/masters/data-science/curriculum-specializations.php>`_
  with a specialization in Data Engineering sometime in the Fall of 2023.

3. Skills Learned Using Written Communication
---------------------------------------------

* **Avoiding Excessive Verbosity**: While technical jargon is important, using it
  excessively, especially in long paragraphs, may distract readers from the point.
  Try to remain clear and concise, or use diagrams and other visual helpers to
  drive the point home. The modern reader has a shorter attention span, and thus
  requires innovative ways to digest pertinent information in short periods of
  time.

* **Using Code Snippets and Examples**: Where possible, especially when discussing
  syntax, show a snippet of the code, and/or highlight the sections you wish to
  draw attention to. This is a better alternative to including links that
  redirect readers to code repositories, as readers may be distracted the moment
  they leave the page. An additional preference of mine is to make sure there
  are comments in my code for ease of readability.

* **Being Mindful of Time-Sensitive References**: Content will eventually get
  outdated as new technology trends come out. When making references, it may be
  helpful to include retrieval dates to ensure content validity. The downside of
  this approach is that it may reduce the value of your content over time, however,
  that can be addressed by making sure you periodically update your content.

4. How Written Communication Will Factor Into My Future Career
--------------------------------------------------------------

Well-written technical documentation is reliable, backed by facts and logic,
and thus minimizes the likelihood of issues arising. Currently, I am QA Engineer,
however, my future career will either take the database or programming route.

As a Data Engineer (though this would apply to Database Administrators,
Data Scientists and SQL Developers), technical documentation ensures a clear
outline of any queries or data adjustments I provide and reduces the chances of
me becoming a single point of failure. As a Software Developer, technical
documentation will assist with installation, troubleshooting, and educating
colleagues on any product, service or enhancements that I deploy.

5. Improving Written Communication Post-Graduation
--------------------------------------------------

I could always ask to be Dr. Craven's assistant and have him review my work
every semester, however, I do not possess the patience to deal with bright young
minds on a daily basis. A more practical solution will involve:

* **Having a Documentation-Awareness Mindset**: Whenever I develop or deploy
  new code, I will consider the merits of documentation (of which, there are
  usually plenty), and where applicable, write the documents based on the
  concepts learned in this class. I have been raising the need for more
  documentation at my workplace, and that will help drive the need to improve
  written communication skills.

* **Request Frequent Peer Reviews from Technical Writer Colleagues**: It helps
  to have a third party, especially a technical writer, read through your
  documentation and provide feedback. Whenever I write up documentation, I will
  make the conscious effort of reaching out to get feedback, which in turn will
  drive my need to improve.

Conclusion
----------

I have seen the fruits of the lessons learned in this class almost real-time,
given that I was applying these lessons to my job. This capstone is, by far,
the most practical class I have had and it has been amazing. Thank you, Dr.
Craven, for your continued feedback and encouragements each week. Please keep
doing what you do!
