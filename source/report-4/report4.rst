Report 4: Browser & Elements
============================

This report covers activities performed between 1/29/22 - 2/4/22. So far, we
have explored setting up selenium webdriver and configuring browser driver. This
topic explores the activities that occur on the browser side of automation,
including:

* Fetching Browser Information
* Identifying Elements on a Page (Locators)
* Interacting with the Elements
* Example Test Cases

.. _browser information:

Browser Information
-------------------

The Selenium WebDriver :ref:`architecture <selenium webdriver>` diagram
shows Browsers as the final stage of automation. This is due to all key
automation functions happening on the browser side, which then relays status
reports back to the WebDriver with each iteration. The browser is the medium
upon which all automation functions all automation activities occur.

In :ref:`Configuration <configuration>` , we learned the command to launch a
browser-instance via the browser-driver (example: ``chromedriver``).
